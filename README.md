Chess Game Board Structure
Row Structure: Each row is represented by a series of div elements, with the first element being a div class='cellprefix' element containing the row number (1-8).

Square Structure: Each square is represented by a div class='gamecell' element, with an optional grey class to indicate a dark-colored square. The id attribute of each square is in the format x_y, where x is the column letter (a-h) and y is the row number (1-8).

JAVASCRIPT

Turn Indicator:
The turn indicator is displayed below the chess game board and is represented by a div id='turn' element. The text content of this element is set to "It's Whites Turn!" by default.

Game Board:
The game board is styled using the #game selector, which sets the width, height, and margin of the board. The cellprefix and gamecell selectors style the individual cells on the board.

Pieces:
The pieces are styled using the neonblue_txt, neonorange_txt, and neongreen_txt selectors, which add a neon effect to the piece symbols.

Animations:
The code includes several animations, such as neonBlueText, neonOrangeText, and neonGreenText, which add a neon effect to the piece symbols. The shake-little animation is used to create a shaking effect on the pieces.

Other Elements:
The code also styles other elements, such as the #turn selector, which styles the turn indicator.

Game Setup:
The game setup is handled by the gamesetup method, which initializes the game board and pieces.

Piece Movement:
The piece movement is handled by the moveoptions method, which calculates the possible moves for a given piece. The method uses a switch statement to determine the type of piece and its corresponding movement rules.

Capturing:
The capturing of pieces is handled by the capture method, which updates the game state and removes the captured piece from the board.

Turn Management:
The turn management is handled by the endturn method, which switches the turn between white and black.

Event Handling:
The event handling is done using jQuery, which listens for clicks on the game cells and handles the game logic accordingly.
